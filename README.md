# **JavaScript React Brewdog Project**
_This is our fourth project on the _nology course and our first project using React._
_We were challeged to make a website to display Brewdog Beers by pulling information through from an API. We were also required to add a search bar and 3 filters._
_I used React, SCSS and JavaScript._
_This is the link to the website https://hope-sugden.github.io/brewdog-project/_



## **User Guide**

### 50 beer cards are displayed when the page first loads.
### There is a 'more info' button within each card which will pop up another card to display additional information about that beer. 
### When something is typed in the search bar the display will change after every character typed. It is a fuzzy search so the results will show anything that includes the search term within the beer name.
### The ABV filter will show any beers with an ABV higher than 6%.
### The Classic Range filter will show anything with a 'first brewed' date before 2010.
### The Low Acidity filter will show anything with a pH level of less than 4.
### The filters are fixed so will be seen on the lefthand side of the page at all times. However, if using a screen smaller than 750px then the filters will be found at the top of the page. 
### I also added in the number of results found which is displayed under the searchbar

## **Limitations**
